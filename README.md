# Sveltos vCluster Automation on EKS

This repo contains everything you'll need to test out automting the installation and management of vCluster instances on EKS, using Sveltos. All you need is an AWS account and a Kind cluster.

You can also opt to install the vClusters in a different host cluster, but just note that the K8s configs in this repo have only been tested on EKS. There may be subtle changes that you'll have to handle on your own.
